## 📑 Project Overview

**MDResNet** modifies the traditional **ResNet architecture** to enhance its capability in detecting malware, focusing on complex threats such as polymorphic and zero-day malware. This repository hosts the code, datasets, and comprehensive documentation used in our research, showcasing superior performance against traditional models like ResNet-18/34.

## 📊 Dataset

Our models are trained on diverse malware image datasets, designed to challenge and test the robustness of MDResNet:

- **Malware-500**: Derived from 12,000 base samples across 9 classes, using undersampling to ensure equity.
- **Malware-1000**: 10,000 images, enhanced with data augmentation for richer training data.
- **Malware-5000**: Our largest dataset with 50,000 images, providing the depth needed for comprehensive model training.

## 🚀 Usage
Train and evaluate the models with ease:
```python
python train.py --dataset [dataset_path] --model [mdresnet18|mdresnet34|mdensedresnet18|mdensedresnet34]
python evaluate.py --model_path [path_to_trained_model]
