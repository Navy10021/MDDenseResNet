## 📊 Dataset

Our models are trained on diverse malware image datasets, designed to challenge and test the robustness of MDResNet:

- **Malware-500**: Derived from 12,000 base samples across 9 classes, using undersampling to ensure equity.
- **Malware-1000**: 10,000 images, enhanced with data augmentation for richer training data.
- **Malware-5000**: Our largest dataset with 50,000 images, providing the depth needed for comprehensive model training.

## 🚀 Usage
Data preprocessing and Train & evaluate the models with ease 
Train and evaluate the models with ease:
```python
python malware_dataset.py --dataset [dataset_path]
python model_train.py --dataset [dataset_path] --model [mdresnet18|mdresnet34|mdensedresnet18|mdensedresnet34]
